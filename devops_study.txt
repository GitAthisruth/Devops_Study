Devops

A methadology that helps engineering teams build products by continously getting user feedback.


DEVOPS - > plan - code - build - test - release - deploy - operate - monitor 


Devops Engineering Definition -  Practical use of Devops within software engineering teams.Being able to build,test, release and monitor applications.


Devops Engineering Pillars 

1. Pull Request Automation 

2. Deployment Automation

3. Application Performance management



Pull Request Automation 

1. Developers share code changes using git tools like github,gitlab and Bitbucket.


2. A set of code changes in git tools is called a "pull request" or "merge request".


3. If pull requests are approved, the code changes can go into the main codebase.



Deployment Automation

1. Deploy a feature to a certain set of users as a final test before rolling it out publically.

2. Starting new versions of services without causing downtime 

3. Rolling back to the prior version in case something does go wrong.

Git Definition

 
Git is used for cloud-based code change collaboration. See the full history of code changes,review developer changes, and store in files called repositories.


What can you automate ?


Continous Integration (CI)

Per change ephemeral environments 

Automated security scanning 

Notifications to reviewers


Goal as Devops Engineer

Help developer change proposals get reviewed and merged within 24 hours of when they are made. 

Have the right tools in place that facilitate deployment without having to have too much custom code. 


Application Performance management

1. Metrics: numeric measurements of key numbers in production.

2. Logging: text descriptions of what is happening during processing 

3. Monitoring: take metrics and logs to convert them into health metrics.

4. Alerting: if monitoring detects a problem, it notifies developer.
